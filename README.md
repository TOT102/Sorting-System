# Main idea

The front end of a simple application designed for the inventory management needs of TOT102 and Uni4Kids. It sends HTTP requests to a [google apps script](https://www.google.com/script/start/), that manages a google sheets table. [QR/Barcode](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) scanning is used for obtaining the ID parameter for a given product.

## Functionalities

• Read the quantity for a provided id parametar(obtained by scanning a QR code).  
• Modify this quantity by subtracting a given amount.

## Installation

The [generated APK](https://github.com/TOT102/Sorting_System/tree/master/app/release) file is located in:
```
